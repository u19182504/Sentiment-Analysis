# Sentiment-Analysis
Comparing customer reviews from 3 different datasets using sentiment analysis techniques. 
- The data is first cleaned before analysed (even though cleaning compromises the sentiment analysis to some extent).
- Similar reviews are grouped using the kmeans algorithm.
- Used wordclouds to visualize the most frequent words in the customer reviews.
- Calculated some evaluation metrics and plotted additional plots.
